    "## 1. Policy Gradient Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "**Theorem Statement:**\n",
    "The policy gradient theorem states that for any differentiable policy π(a|s;θ), the gradient of the performance objective J(θ) with respect to the policy parameters θ is:\n",
    "\n",
    "∇θ J(θ) = E[∇θ log π(a|s;θ) * Q^π(s,a)]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Significance:**\n",
    "- Provides an **exact expression** for the policy gradient without needing to compute gradients of the state distribution\n",
    "- Enables **temporal credit assignment** - connects actions to long-term consequences via Q-values\n",
    "- Forms the **foundation for all policy gradient methods** (REINFORCE, Actor-Critic, PPO, etc.)\n",
    "- Allows **online learning** - policies can be improved while collecting experience\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Parameterized Policies\n",
    "\n",
    "**Softmax Policy Example:**\n",
    "For discrete actions, a parameterized softmax policy can be defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "π(a|s;θ) = exp(h(s,a;θ)) / Σ_{a'} exp(h(s,a';θ))\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- h(s,a;θ) are the **action preferences** (logits) parameterized by θ\n",
    "- For linear approximation: h(s,a;θ) = θ^T φ(s,a) where φ(s,a) is a feature vector\n",
    "- For neural networks: h(s,a;θ) is the output of a neural network\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives higher probability to actions with higher preferences while maintaining exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Actor-Critic vs. Pure Policy Gradient\n",
    "\n",
    "**Two Advantages:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Reduced Variance**: Actor-Critic methods use a value function (critic) to estimate the advantage, which has much lower variance than the Monte Carlo returns used in pure policy gradients like REINFORCE.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sample Efficiency**: By learning a value function, Actor-Critic can learn from incomplete episodes and reuse experience more effectively through bootstrapping, whereas pure policy gradients typically require complete episodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Imitation Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "**Behavior Cloning vs. Inverse Reinforcement Learning:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Behavior Clustering**: Supervised learning approach that directly maps states to actions using expert demonstrations. Treats imitation as a classification/regression problem. **Limitation**: No reasoning about why actions are taken, susceptible to compounding errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Inverse Reinforcement Learning**: Learns the underlying reward function that explains expert behavior, then finds optimal policy for that reward. **Advantage**: Generalizes better and understands the intent behind actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Reward Shaping\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition**: Reward shaping modifies the original reward function by adding additional shaping rewards to provide more frequent learning signals and guide the agent toward desired behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Potential-Based Reward Shaping**: A specific form where shaping rewards are defined as:\n",
    "F(s,a,s') = γΦ(s') - Φ(s)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Useful**:\n",
    "- **Policy invariance guarantee**: Doesn't change the optimal policy, only affects learning speed\n",
    "- **Provides intermediate guidance**: Helps with credit assignment in sparse reward environments\n",
    "- **Mathematically sound**: Preserves convergence guarantees of original RL algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Maximum Entropy Principle\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Maximizing Entropy Helps Exploration:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Prevents Premature Convergence**: By encouraging higher entropy (more random policies), the agent continues exploring and avoids getting stuck in suboptimal deterministic policies early in training.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Robustness to Uncertainty**: In partially observable or noisy environments, maximum entropy policies are more robust because they distribute probability mass across multiple plausible actions rather than over-committing to one.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Better Coverage of State Space**: High-entropy policies visit more diverse states, leading to better value function estimates and discovering potentially better strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Connection to Optimality**: In the maximum entropy framework, the optimal policy explicitly balances reward maximization with entropy, leading to policies that are optimal while maintaining stochasticity where multiple good actions exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mathematical Insight**: The maximum entropy objective J(θ) = E[Σγ^t(r_t + αH(π(·|s_t)))] explicitly trades off reward and entropy, where α controls the exploration-exploitation balance."
